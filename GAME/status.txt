Going quite well,
done with basic mechanics like collision/shooting + killing/multiple levels/ health/mana bars/animations...

to do :
- add different player actack skill ?
- add shop ?
- add skilltree ?
- add more level?(current 3)
- add some AI mechanics( currently just moving sideways back and forth )
